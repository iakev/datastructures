    "## Problem statement\n",
    "Implement a block chain as a linked list storing the hash of previous block and each block having its hash,timestamp and data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design considerations\n",
    "Decided to generate random strings as data for each block. The hash for each block was prepared by SHA256 algorithm found in python's `hashlib` library. Hash was generated from data,timestamp and previous block's hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space and Time complexity\n",
    "Adding blocks to chain is a constant time operation hence it's $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space is $O(n)$ since it depends on the number of blocks in the chain.\n"
