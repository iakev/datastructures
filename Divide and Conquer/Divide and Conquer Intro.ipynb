    "# Divide and conquer\n",
    "In this section, we'll discuss algorithms that use a strategy called **divide and conquer** to solve problems more efficiently. The name comes from the idea that the algorithm will break `(or divide)` the problem down into sub-problems that can be more easily solved `(or conquered)`. Then, the solutions to these sub-problems are combined to yield an answer to the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next several videos, Eric will walk through an exampleâ€”specifically, he'll demonstrate how to use a divide and conquer algorithm to efficiently find the median element out of a collection of unsorted numbers. Following this, you'll have the opportunity to do some hands-on work and solve several different problems using a divide-and-conquer approach."

    "**Additional Read** - The problem of finding $k^{th}$ smallest element from an unsorted array is generally called as **$k^{th}$ order statistic**. The BFPRT (1973) solution mentioned above is widely known as [Median of medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians), that we will discuss in the next video."

    "1. The final algorithm starts with an assumption that \"pivot p is good\" and in the end, it is able to solve the problem in `O(n)` time. This proves that the assumption was correct.\n",
    "2. In step 2 shown in the video, even if we consider that it takes `O(k)` time for finding the median of a group (of size 5 elements), the overall algorithm will have an `O(n)` time complexity in the worst case."
