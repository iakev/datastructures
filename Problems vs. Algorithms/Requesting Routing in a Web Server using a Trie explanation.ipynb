    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Create a Trie datastructure and use it to make a router to serve up content according to the matched url path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Consideerations\n",
    "A dictionary eas used to implement the trie as it proved to be quite easy to visulaize and implement tries using a dictionary. However now the dictionary keys are separated and informed by `/`. We use `/` to separate the input path into separate keys to be added to a trie. The last key will contain the content of interest that when requested needs to be served up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space and Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the dictionary being used the time complexity for accessing, deleting and searching for a trie is `O(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity for a trie creation is `O(m*n)`, where `m` is the numer of nodes created and `n` is the average length of keys in the trie."
